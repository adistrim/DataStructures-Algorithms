# Stack

## A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It is an abstract data type that can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.

## The stack has two primary operations: push and pop. Push adds an element to the top of the stack, and pop removes the element from the top of the stack. The element added last is the first element to be removed (LIFO).

## In addition to push and pop, stacks also have other operations, such as peek (to view the top element without removing it), size (to get the number of elements in the stack), and isEmpty (to check if the stack is empty or not).

## Stacks are commonly used in programming and computer science for tasks such as expression evaluation, syntax parsing, memory management, and undo/redo functionalities in software applications.
