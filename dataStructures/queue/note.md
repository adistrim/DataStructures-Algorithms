# Queue

## A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It is an abstract data type that can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.

## A queue has two primary operations: enqueue and dequeue. Enqueue adds an element to the back of the queue, and dequeue removes the element from the front of the queue. The element added first is the first element to be removed (FIFO).

## In addition to enqueue and dequeue, queues also have other operations, such as peek (to view the front element without removing it), size (to get the number of elements in the queue), and isEmpty (to check if the queue is empty or not).

## Queues are commonly used in programming and computer science for tasks such as scheduling, job processing, network packet handling, and message passing between threads.
